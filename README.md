If you are using non-whitelisted plugins for your Jekyll site then you probably can't host on Github Pages.
Jekyll GhDeploy is meant to take away the pain of building and pushing your Jekyll site to Github while keeping it version controlled.     

## Installation

Add these lines to your site's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
   gem "jekyll-ghdeploy"
end

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-ghdeploy

## Usage

Specify your repository inside of your configuration file with `username` being
your Github username and `repository` being your repository's name. 

    repository: username/repository

Execute the command by typing `bundle exec jekyll ghdeploy`

    $ bundle exec jekyll ghdeploy

You can alternatively specify your repository while executing the command.

    $ bundle exec jekyll ghdeploy username/repository

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-d` or `--docs` | Built site is stored inside of `docs` directory |
| `-m` or `--message` | Custom commit message |
